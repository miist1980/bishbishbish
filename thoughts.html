    <p style="color: blue">24.10.13; 20.16</p><p>basically, i have an equation in my head.<br>african electric guitar + tabla/mridangam + wurlitzer (me) + voice (also me) + bansuri = true devotion<br>and in my head i know exactly how its supposed to sound, but IT ISN'T OUT OF MY HEAD YET<br>and i think part of it is me actually finding the right people becaue it can't just be all me.<br>"when three or more are gathered in my name, there am i in their midst"</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="color: blue">24.10.11; 11.21</p><p>and then i realize, "what's the point of documenting all your thoughts if you're only keeping the good ones up"<br>and then i start thinking about how that's pretty much all social media<br>people choose to show you the best of the best of the good shit<br>and then i resolve never to delete anything from my website again<br>and then i resolve that that resolve will probably be broken someday<br>and then i spiral into existential thought about meaning and meaninglessness</p>
